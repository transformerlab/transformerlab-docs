## Platform Specific Tips:

### Windows 

1. Make sure you have WSL and CUDA drivers installed ([detailed instructions here](./windows-wsl-cuda.md))

### Linux 

:::tip
Transformer Lab should work on most distros of Linux that support your GPU. We recommend [PopOS](https://pop.system76.com/) because it has great support for automatically installing NVIDIA drivers.

If you have a machine with an [AMD GPU, follow the instructions here](./install-on-amd.md).

:::

### Step 1 - Ensure NVIDIA Drivers are Installed

If you installed PopOS you will have the option to select an NVIDIA enabled version of PopOS installed by default. You can test that NVIDIA support is successfully installed by running the following command in a command prompt and you should get output similar to what is shown below:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

If this worked, congratulations, NVIDIA support for your Linux install is working and you can proceed with downloading and installing Transformer Lab.

If you need to install the nvidia drivers from scratch, there are instructions below for different versions of Linux:

- For PopOS: https://support.system76.com/articles/system76-driver/
- For Ubuntu: https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/nvidia-drivers-installation
- For everything else: https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/driver-installation-guide/index.html
