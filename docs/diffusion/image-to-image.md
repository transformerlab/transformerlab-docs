# Image-to-Image Processing

Transform existing images using diffusion models with text guidance in TransformerLab.

## Overview

Image-to-image processing allows you to modify existing images using text prompts while preserving the original structure and composition. This powerful feature enables creative transformations, style transfers, and artistic modifications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Downloaded diffusion model (see [Downloading Models](./downloading-models.md))
- Source image to transform
- Clear text prompt describing desired changes
- Sufficient GPU memory for inference

### Basic Workflow

1. Load your source image
2. Select appropriate diffusion model
3. Write transformation prompt
4. Set strength parameter
5. Generate transformed image

## Key Parameters

### Strength Parameter

The strength parameter controls how much the original image is preserved:
- **Low strength (0.1-0.3)**: Subtle modifications, preserves most original details
- **Medium strength (0.4-0.7)**: Balanced transformation
- **High strength (0.8-1.0)**: Major changes, less original image preservation

### Other Important Settings

- **Steps**: Denoising steps for quality
- **Guidance Scale**: Prompt adherence strength
- **Seed**: For reproducible results
- **Resolution**: Output dimensions

## Use Cases

### Style Transfer

Transform images to different artistic styles:
```
Convert this photo to impressionist painting style
```

### Object Modification

Change specific elements in images:
```
Replace the dog with a cat, same pose and lighting
```

### Environmental Changes

Alter backgrounds and settings:
```
Change the sunny day to a stormy evening
```

### Enhancement and Restoration

Improve image quality or add details:
```
Enhance details, professional photography quality
```

## Best Practices

### Choosing Source Images

- Use high-quality source images
- Ensure good lighting and contrast
- Consider composition complexity
- Match aspect ratios when possible

### Prompt Writing

- Reference the original image context
- Be specific about desired changes
- Include style and quality descriptors
- Use negative prompts to avoid unwanted changes

### Parameter Tuning

- Start with medium strength (0.5)
- Adjust based on results
- Higher steps for better quality
- Experiment with different samplers

## Advanced Techniques

### Masked Transformations

- Focus changes on specific regions
- Preserve important image areas
- Combine with inpainting techniques

### Batch Processing

- Process multiple images with same settings
- Maintain consistency across image sets
- Efficient workflow for large projects

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Too much change**: Lower strength parameter
- **Not enough change**: Increase strength or guidance scale
- **Poor quality**: Increase steps or try different sampler
- **Memory errors**: Reduce image resolution or batch size

### Quality Tips

- Use descriptive, detailed prompts
- Match prompt style to desired output
- Consider original image lighting and perspective
- Iterate with different parameters
