Recipes in Transformer Lab are pre-defined workflows designed to help you get started with common tasks, such as training, evaluating, quantizing, or exporting models. Each recipe provides step-by-step guidance tailored to a specific architecture or use case.

## What Are Recipes?

Recipes in Transformer Lab are ready-made workflows/tasks that help you complete common tasks like training, evaluating, or exporting machine learning models. Think of them as step-by-step guides that make it easier to get started, even if you're new to the platform.

Each recipe is designed for a specific goal — such as summarizing a conversation, generating Python code, or fine-tuning a model — and is built to match different types of hardware like NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, Apple Silicon (MLX), or CPUs.

## Why Use Recipes?

**Saves time:** You don’t need to set everything up from scratch. Recipes come with pre-filled configurations and helpful defaults.

**Beginner-friendly:** If you're unsure how to train or evaluate a model, a recipe walks you through it.

**Task-specific:** Each recipe focuses on a clear outcome — like answering SQL questions or quantizing a model — so you know exactly what it’s meant for.

**Hardware-aware:** Recipes are tailored to the hardware you're using, so they’re optimized to run smoothly.

In short, recipes help you launch powerful experiments with less setup and more confidence.

## How to Launch a Recipe and Create an Experiment

There are two primary ways to get started with a recipe on Transformer Lab:

**1. First-Time Setup / Initial Connection:**
When you start Transformer Lab for the very first time and successfully connect to the API server or your local machine, you'll be presented with an intuitive screen specifically for choosing a recipe based on your hardware architecture. From there, you can select the recipe that aligns with your goals and create a new experiment based on it.

**2. Creating a New Experiment from Anywhere:**
Once you're familiar with the platform, you can create a new experiment from a recipe at any time. Simply navigate to the drop-down menu (usually located in the top navigation or a prominent "Create" button) and click on "+New". This will open up the options to select a recipe supported by your hardware and configure your new experiment.
