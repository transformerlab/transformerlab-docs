# Transformer Lab Local


Transformer Lab is a free, open-source LLM and Diffusion workspace that you can run on your own computers or in the cloud. It is designed to go beyond what most modern open LLM and Diffusion applications allow. Using Transformer Lab you can easily finetune, evaluate, export and test AI models across different inference engines and platforms.

Transformer Lab works well for users with access to a GPU or TPU (local or in the cloud). It also works well on M-series (M1, M2, M3) Apple Mac computers using <a href="https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx">MLX</a>.

You can contribute plugins or to the core application -- we'd love your help! Start by joining our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/transformerlab"><FaDiscord/> Discord</a>.
