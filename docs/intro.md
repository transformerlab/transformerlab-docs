# Introduction

## What is Transformer Lab?

<!-- <img src={require('/img/flask.png').default} alt="Login Modal" width="80" /> -->

Transformer Lab is a free, open-source LLM and Diffusion workspace that you can run on your own computers or in the cloud. It is designed to go beyond what most modern open LLM and Diffusion applications allow. Using Transformer Lab you can easily finetune, evaluate, export and test AI models across different inference engines and platforms.

Transformer Lab works well for users with access to a GPU or TPU (local or in the cloud). It also works well on M-series (M1, M2, M3) Apple Mac computers using <a href="https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx">MLX</a>.

You can contribute plugins or to the core application -- we'd love your help! Start by joining our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/transformerlab"><FaDiscord/> Discord</a>.

### What can I do with Transformer Lab?

With Transformer Lab, you can:

1. **Download** LLMs and Diffusion Models
2. **Chat** with LLMs, and **generate images** with Diffusion Models
3. Calculate LLM **embeddings**
4. **Create and download datasets** for training LLMs and Image Models
5. **Finetune and Train** LLMs and Diffusion Models
6. **Training using RLHF or Preference Tuning**
7. **Use RAG** to talk to your documents

And **more**. The best way to learn about how you can use Transformer Lab is to watch an end-to-end tutorial video.

## Intro Video

The easiest way to learn about Transformer Lab is to watch the [5 Minute Getting Started Video](https://youtu.be/tY5TAvKviLo) to get a quick tour.

## Recipes: Pre-defined Workflows

After launching Transformer Lab, and when creating a new experiment, you have the option of starting your next project from a Recipe. Recipes in Transformer Lab are ready-made workflows/tasks that help you complete common tasks like training, evaluating, or exporting machine learning models. Think of them as step-by-step guides that make it easier to get started, even if you're new to the platform.
