# Transformer Lab


Transformer Lab is a free, open-source machine learning research platform that you can run on your own computers or in the cloud. It is designed to go beyond what most modern open LLM and Diffusion applications allow. Using Transformer Lab you can easily finetune, evaluate, export and test AI models across different inference engines and platforms.

## Transformer Lab Local

Transformer Lab can be run locally as a platform to train, tune, or evaluate AI models on a single machine.
