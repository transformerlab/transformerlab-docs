# Transformer Lab


Transformer Lab is a free, open-source machine learning research platform that you can run on your own computers or in the cloud.


## Which Edition is Right For Me?

Transformer Lab can be run in one of two modes: Single Node or (our soon to be announced) Super-Duper Team Cloud Mode.

If you want to run Transformer Lab just for yourself, follow the [standard, single node install instructions here](./install/install.md).

If you are on a team, and want to run Transformer Lab, with access to cluster of GPUs (using SLURM or Skypilot, for example) [follow these steps to enable Super-Duper Team Cloud Mode](/install/team.md).
