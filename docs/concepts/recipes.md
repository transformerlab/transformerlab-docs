# Recipes

import Button from '@site/src/components/Button';

A recipe is simply a way of saving and sharing workflows in Transformer Lab. 
Today recipes are used to define training templates, but in the future Transformer Lab will automate more using recipes.

You can install a recipe by going to the Training page and selecting "Recipe Library" under the <Button>+ New</Button> button.
There you will be able to select a recipe from the Transformer Lab recipe gallery,
or import a recipe from a file you have on your system.

You can also export a recipe that you can share with others by clicking the download button on a row in the Training Templates list.
