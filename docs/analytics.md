# Analytics and Telemetry

Transformer Lab is composed of two parts. The API (the server that does the Machine Learning work), and the App (the graphical user interface that access the API).

Our API does not have any embedded analytics or telemetry.

Our App includes very basic telemetry that allows the Transformer Lab Maintainers to get anonymous data around usage, without sacrificing privacy.

You can opt-out of telemetry at any time by going to **Settings->Do Not Share Any Data**

## What kind of data do and don't we collect?

Transformer Lab gathers anonymous data around what features of the app are used, and how frequently.

This may include:
- What general pages of the app users visit, in aggregate
- Which parts of the app crash

We do NOT gather:
- Personal information about users
- Custom information such as the name of your experiments, data, custom models, or end results

## Why do we gather data

We uses technical and interaction data for many things, including to:

**Fix problems:** Identify bugs and improve the app's performance.

**Build better features:** See which features are popular and how we can improve them.

**Understand trends:** Learn how people use the product without compromising their privacy.
