## Recipes: Pre-defined Experiment Templates

After launching Transformer Lab, and when creating a new experiment, you have the option of starting your next project from a Recipe. Recipes in Transformer Lab are ready-made template experiments that help you complete common tasks like training, evaluating, or exporting machine learning models. Think of them as step-by-step guides that make it easier to get started, even if you're new to the platform.
