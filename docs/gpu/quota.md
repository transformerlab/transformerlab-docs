# Quota

:::info

Full documentation is coming in the upcoming days. Until then, please reach out through discord or our signup form.

:::

Administrators can assign a global quota to all the members in an organization (which can be equal to zero). On top of this, each team and individual can have overrides so that you could, for example, offer 10 units of quota to every user, but provide 20 units to everyone in the "research" team.

Quota is defined as "credits" where one credit roughly maps to $1 USD of cost, where Transformer Lab (using skypilot) estimates the cost of the cost of GPUs per hour based on public information provided by each cloud.
