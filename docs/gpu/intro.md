# Transformer Lab GPU Orchestration

Using GPU Orchestration in Transformer Lab, users can run workloads across multiple GPUs in the cloud or on prem.

Researchers can:

1) Reserve machines across multiple clouds
2) Run jobs across multiple nodes

While allowing the whole team to manage shared storage, checkpoints, and quota across multiple users.
