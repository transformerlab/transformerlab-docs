# Setup Node Pools

:::info

Full documentation is coming in the upcoming days. Until then, please reach out through discord or our signup form.

The first step in configuring Transformer Lab is to set up node pools. A node pool is a group of compute resources available to your team. This can be compute from a large cloud provider (for example, GCP or AWS), a neocloud (such as Runpod), or your own on-premises compute.

## Use your Own Compute

Transformer Lab does not provide compute itself. To use Transformer Lab, you add credentials for the compute your organization has access to, and Transformer Lab makes those resources available to your researchers.

## Who can Access a Node Pool?

Administrators can add one or more node pools and configure them to be accessible by all members of an organization or only certain teams.

## How to add a node pool

If you have admin privileges, go to Admin -> Node Pools and follow the on-screen steps. Typically, you will need to add the cloud-specific credentials for each cloud provider.
