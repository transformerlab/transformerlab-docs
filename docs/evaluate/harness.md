## 3. Configuring the Evaluation Task

Configure your evaluation task by following these steps:

- **Name Your Evaluation Task:** Enter a descriptive name for easy identification.
- **Select Evaluation Tasks:** Choose the suite of tasks within the Harness that you wish to evaluate.
- **Define the Evaluation Scope:** Select the fraction of samples to evaluate. The recommended fraction is `1` (using the full benchmark) for a thorough assessment. For testing or debugging, you can choose a lower fraction.
