# Transformer Lab is a Company

Transformer Lab is now an official company!

Timed with our company launch today at [Mozilla's Demo Day](https://future.mozilla.org/builders/), we are excited to be able to announce that Transformer Lab as a company is officially launching.

## First our backstory...

Tony and I have been working together for more than 20 years. We've always loved solving complex technology problems, while simultaneously focusing on user experience.

Like many of you, over the past years we've been trying our best to learn from and contribute to the world of generative AI. LLMs are magical 🪄. And they are fun 🥳.

But for a while, it looked like the only way to really work with LLMs was if you worked at one of a handful of large companies.

But then something interesting happened...

## The rise of local, open LLMs

The open souce community along with a few large companies like Hugging Face, Meta, and Alibaba all started launching open-weight models. All of a sudden, you could download and run models on your home computer that rivaled the best models from only a few months before.

But...

Working with all of the amazing local and open LLM tools out there is **a nightmare** 👿. Getting Python, and Python Dependencies, and CUDA, and FlashAttention, and... it's a terribly frustrating ecosystem to work in unless you love looking at pages of errors like the following: 🤮

So for the past year, we have been focused exclusively on this problem:

<p style={{fontSize: "20pt", fontWeight: "600", padding: "20px 40px 20px 20px", borderLeft: "6px solid #444"}}>How can we make is so that any developer can instantly be an advanced LLM engineer?</p>

## Our vision

Our long-term goal is to make Transformer Lab into the very best platform for developers, researchers, and hobbyists to build, train, and tune LLMs. And we believe in open source as the best way to maximize impact and access.

## Let's work together

Here are ways we'd love to collaborate:

- Please [try out Transformer Lab](http://transformerlab.ai/docs/local/download) and let us know what you think
- We are looking for open source contributions on [Github](https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app)
- Are you building tools in the LLM ecosystem that could benefit from a better GUI? Let's build together.
- Are you a company that trains LLMs for yourself or others? Please reach out on how we could make your life easier
- We're hiring, mainly looking for folks who are able to be productive in a small team. If you've been training models or working with LLMs in the past, that's a bonus

The best way to contact us is through our [Discord](https://discord.gg/transformerlab) channel.
