# What is Transformer Lab?

Transformer Lab is an open source platform that allows anyone to build, tune, & run Large Language Models locally, without writing code.

We imagine a world where every software developer will incorporate large language models in their products. Transformer Lab allows users to do this without needing to know Python nor have previous experience with machine learning.
