## Artifact, Dataset, and Checkpoint Management

Systematically manage your artifacts, data, models, and checkpoints, tracking exactly which code, dataset version, and config produced a specific checkpoint. Resume training instantly after a failure without wasting compute. All data is synchronized across nodes and between trains, even when using ephemeral compute, ensuring your assets are always accessible.
