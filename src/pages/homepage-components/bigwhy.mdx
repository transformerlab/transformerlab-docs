# We're building a Machine Learning Research Platform (MLRP) for the World's Best Research Teams

Transformer Lab offers a set of tools that manage experiments, gpu-orchestration, artifacts, models, and recipes so that researchers can focus on science. Whether your team uses Skypilot, SLURM, or a cloud-specific GPU workload orchestrator, Transformer Lab is a common experimentation framework so researchers can just submit jobs and focus on results.
