# What is an MLRP (Machine Learning Research Platform)?

An MLRP is single interface where ML researchers can run experiments. The MLRP assists with gpu-orchestration, artifacts,
model storage, and recipe sharing, and quota management so that researchers can focus on **science**. Whether your team uses Skypilot,
SLURM, or a cloud-specific GPU workload orchestrator, Transformer Lab provides a single interface
where researchers can just submit jobs (or request direct access to compute) and track and store results.
