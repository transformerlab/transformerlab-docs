# What is an MLRP (Machine Learning Research Platform)?

We're designing what we call an MLRP: a single interface where ML researchers can run, track and store experiments. The MLRP assists with gpu-orchestration, artifacts,
model storage, recipe sharing, and quota management so that researchers can focus on **science**. Whether your team uses Skypilot,
SLURM, or a cloud-specific GPU workload orchestrator, Transformer Lab provides a single interface
where researchers can just submit jobs (or request direct access to compute) and track and store results.
