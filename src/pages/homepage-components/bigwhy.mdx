# Why you need an MLRP (Machine Learning Research Platform)

Transformer Lab offers a set of tools that manage experiments, gpu-orchestration, artifacts,
models, and recipes so that researchers can focus on science. Whether your team uses Skypilot,
SLURM, or a cloud-specific GPU workload orchestrator, Transformer Lab provides a single interface
where researchers can just submit jobs (or request direct access to compute) and archive results.
