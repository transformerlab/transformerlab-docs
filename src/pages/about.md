# This is so fun

We want to build the very best tool for ML teams to build, train, and evaluate advanced AI models. We hope you love using it as much as we love working on it.

# Who are the people behind Transformer Lab?

Transformer Lab is being actively developed by a small team of engineers from Canada led by Tony Salomone, Ali Asaria, and Deep Gandhi.
