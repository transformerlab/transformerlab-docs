# Who are the people behind Transformer Lab?

Transformer Lab was created by a small team of engineers from Canada led by Tony Salomone and Ali Asaria.

# Our Vision

When we started building Transformer Lab we asked ourselves, "what if working with open source LLMs was as easy as working with an open source database?"

In the future, we see a world where opensource models will continue to grow in capability. Our hope is that Transformer Lab is the best starting point to work with local models, making it easy for anyone to adapt LLMs to their own needs, in the cloud or on their own hardware.
