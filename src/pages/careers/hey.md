Hi! :)

We noticed your application.

We're looking to add just a few folks to our small team this year.
The main thing we're looking for are people who understand the basics of LLMs and Machine Learning, while being able to help build complex software quickly. But, honestly, some of us are new to this field.

So really, the most important thing is we're looking for people who can help us build at high velocity. This means people who can quickly dive into our codebase and make changes to create new features or fix things that are broken.

We're not looking for managers, because we're so small.

Maybe a good test to see if you'd like it here is if you have built software in the past where you deployed new code to production 4-5 times in a day, every day. You should care about users, and making them happy. And it really helps if you have good software architecture decision making skills.

We sent you a link to this page because we have a challenge. When we post a job, we get hundreds of applications in hours. But we're such a small team that it would take us weeks to look at every submission.

This is not your fault, it's our job to find good fits.

The challenge we have is that we know there may be great people in the list of people we don't write back to, because we're necessarily taking so many shortcuts when going through applications.

One option we have is to make applicants "jump through hoops" like multiple coding challenges, etc. We know that not everyone has time for all these hoops, especially if they already have a job, family commitments, or are applying to multiple places. For the best developers, it doesn't feel good to have to fight for attention. We should be chasing you.

Ok, so on to the point of this page. We noticed your resume and think you might really like it here. But, it's hard to know about people from a five minute glance at their resume.

If you really, really think you'd be a great fit at Transformer Lab let us know. Here are things you could do to ensure you get our attention:

1. All our code is open source. Take a look at our two main Github repos and see if there are any things you could fix. We have some issues marked as "good first issues". Join our Discord and show us what you built.
2. Message us on LinkedIn or Twitter and send us a link to code that you've built that shows transferable skills to what we're doing.
3. Use Transformer Lab to build something cool. Share your results on Youtube or Twitter and tag us. We'll notice.

We promise we'll do our best to look at everything you send us. Sorry if we don't get back to you right away -- feel free to message us again in a month or two.

Take care!

-ali and tony
