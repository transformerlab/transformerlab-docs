- Delete the Transformer Lab application from your `/Applications` Folder
- Transformer Lab stores models and data in your `~/.transformerlab/` folder -- deleting everything there will destroy all your settings and experiments
- When downloading large models, Transformer Lab often uses Huggingface's tools which download models to `~/.cache/huggingface/hub` delete this directory to remove the large model files
- There may be a small folder in `~/Library/Logs/transformerlab/`

Here is a script you can run in a Terminal that will do all of the above steps:

```bash
rm -rf /Applications/Transformer\ Lab.app/
rm -rf ~/.transformerlab/
rm -rf ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/
rm -rf ~/Library/Logs/transformerlab/
```

This will remove all the packages installed for Transformer Lab, freeing up space.
