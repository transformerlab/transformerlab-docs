Transformer Lab is a free, open-source LLM and Diffusion workspace that you can run on your own computers or in the cloud. It is designed to go beyond what most modern open LLM and Diffusion applications allow. Using Transformer Lab you can easily finetune, evaluate, export and test AI models across different inference engines and platforms.
