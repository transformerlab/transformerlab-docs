# Transformer Lab CLI

Transformer Lab can be accessed via CLI:

<BrowserOnly>
  {() => <AsciinemaPlayer src={"/img/cli/start.cast"} options={{ speed: 2 }} />}
</BrowserOnly>

## Installing the Transformer Lab CLI

Install the `lab` CLI tool using the following command in your terminal (requires `uv`)

```bash
uv tool install "git+https://github.com/transformerlab/transformerlab-app#subdirectory=cli"
```

## Log In

In order to interact with your Transformer Lab instance, `lab` CLI needs to know:

- The URL of the Transformer Lab API you are accessing (e.g. `https://app.lab.cloud` (include the port if you are not running on port 80/443)
- Your user email address
- Your API Key (which you can obtain from the Transformer Lab GUI under User Settings)

You can set all of these by typing

```bash
lab login
```

To get an interactive prompt.

You can also type

```bash
lab login --email admin@example.com --apiKey <INSERT API KEY HERE> --serverURL https://app.lab.cloud
```

To set all of this information in one command.

If you would like to inspect the configuration options above, type:

```bash
lab config
```
