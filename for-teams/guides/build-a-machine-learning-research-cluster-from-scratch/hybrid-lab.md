# The "Hybrid" Lab

## Scenario

**Setup:** You own on-prem hardware for baseline loads but "burst" into the cloud for deadlines or massive runs.

**Challenge:** Networking complexity and data gravity (moving terabytes of datasets back and forth).

## Coming Soon

This guide will cover hybrid infrastructure setup, burst scaling, and managing data movement across on-premises and cloud environments.
