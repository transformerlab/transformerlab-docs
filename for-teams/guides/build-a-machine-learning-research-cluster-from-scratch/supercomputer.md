# The "Supercomputer" (Large-Scale)

## Scenario

**Setup:** A massive deployment of 1000+ nodes, likely with specialized networking (Infiniband).

**Challenge:** Extreme distributed training efficiency, topology awareness, and fault tolerance.

## Coming Soon

This guide will cover distributed training at scale, network topology optimization, and fault tolerance strategies.
